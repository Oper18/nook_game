.
├── default.actions
│
│   Contains a list of actions. An action is a set of node property changes.
│   In this case, it contains single action to rotate a scene node by 360
│   degrees along Y axis for 1000 milliseconds.
│
├── default.compositor
│
│   Contains a list of materials. A material is a set of textures applied
│   to a node's model.
│   In this case, it contains diffuse and normal maps (textures) applied
